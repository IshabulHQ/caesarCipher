Feature of Caesar Cipher Algorithm

This encryption technique is used to encrypt plain text, so only the person you want can read it. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

In this encryption technique, to encrypt our data,  we have to replace each letter in the text by a some other letter at a fixed difference. Text already encrypted can be decrypted.
